Receipt Processor
This is a beginner-friendly web service that processes receipts and calculates points based on predefined rules. It exposes two endpoints: POST /receipts/process to process a receipt and generate an ID, and GET /receipts/{id}/points to retrieve the points awarded for a processed receipt.

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository or download the source code.

Make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: https://golang.org/dl/

Install the required dependencies by running the following commands in your terminal:

arduino
Copy code
go get -u github.com/google/uuid
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Build the application by running the following command:

go
Copy code
go build
Run the application by executing the following command:

bash
Copy code
./receipt-processor
The server will start running on your local machine at localhost:8080.

API Endpoints
Process Receipts
Endpoint: /receipts/process
Method: POST
Payload: JSON receipt
Response: JSON containing an ID for the receipt
This endpoint allows you to process a receipt and receive a unique ID for it. To process a receipt, send a POST request to /receipts/process with a JSON payload representing the receipt. The server will generate an ID for the receipt and return it in the response.

Get Points
Endpoint: /receipts/{id}/points
Method: GET
Response: JSON object containing the number of points awarded
This endpoint allows you to retrieve the number of points awarded for a processed receipt based on its ID. To retrieve the points, send a GET request to /receipts/{id}/points, replacing {id} with the ID of the receipt you want to query. The server will return the points awarded in the response.

Points Calculation
The calculatePoints function in the code is responsible for calculating the points based on predefined rules. As a beginner, you can customize this function to implement your own rules or connect to a database to retrieve the points for a given receipt ID.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully set up and explored the Receipt Processor web service. This beginner-friendly project allows you to process receipts and calculate points based on predefined rules. Feel free to experiment with the code and make it your own.
